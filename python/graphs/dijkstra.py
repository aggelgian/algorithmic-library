"""
    Dijkstra's ALgorithm
    --------------------

    Finds the shortest paths between nodes in a graph

    Parameters:
    Graph
        The graph as an adjacency list.
    Root
        The root vertex.

    Returns:
    Cost
        A dictionary that maps vertices to the cost of the shortest path from the root to them.
    Parent
        A dictionary tham maps vertices to their parent in the shortest path from the root to them.
        It is needed to reconstruct the shortest path.
